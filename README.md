# TactAid
Although this project was done in a group of three, Everything in this repository is contributed by me. My objective was to prove that we can use simple ultra-sonic sensors found in an arduino kit to enable the blind to navigate through various situations using haptic feedback to tell them the distance to different objects. The file and presentation containing the step-by-step instruction to build the prototype was contributed by one of my team-mates and they have deleted their old account. I will try to make the arduino instructable to fill in the gaps to my code as a major part of this project is to help people build things that benefit those that are differently abled around us. I will also add pictures and fritzing sketches that I captured/designed in this repository.
